                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Integration specialist intern at CAE and John Abbott College Computer Science student, I am a young and passionate programmer. 
                    I am eager to learn and ready to apply skills that I learned in my previous jobs and at school. Throughout 
                    my past work experience, I learned a lot on how to talk to clients, handle escalated situations, and how to perform 
                    and lead effectively under pressure. Young and passionate I am ready to further my skills in programming languages that 
                    I already know, or to expand my knowledge by learning new languages and algorithms.</p>

                <p> 
                    <br><br>
                    On a more personal note, I am a very active person. I love to play and watch sports, especially hockey.
                    I am a Referee in hockey currently working for the elite staff of the Lac St-Louis region, working on
                    RSEQ games in the Lac St-Louis region, and working locally with the staff of Beauharnois and Valleyfield.
                    I would hope to one day be able to referee at the higher levels of hockey, such as provincial games, semi-pro 
                    or even professional games. I am also a very passionate gamer, I love to play video games, sometimes even too much!
